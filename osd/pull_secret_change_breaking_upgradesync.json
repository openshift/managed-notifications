  "description": "Your cluster requires you to take action because the Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) have detected that your cluster's pull secret has been updated or modified by a user on your cluster, specifically the 'cloud.redhat.com' token is either missing or is not associated with the cluster owner. Without this, Red Hat SRE's ability to monitor and support your cluster will be impacted, as will your cluster's ability to initiate any upgrades. Please ensure that the pull secret contains the contents of the pull secret available from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads#.",
