    "description": "Your cluster requires you to take action because the cluster's image registry is in a degraded state due to a misconfiguration. A trusted CA ConfigMap has been added to the 'cluster' images.config.openshift.io resource's 'additionalTrustedCA' section, but the corresponding ConfigMap does not exist in the openshift-config namespace. Please create that ConfigMap by following the product documentation: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cicd/builds/setting-up-trusted-ca.html. Without action, the image registry will remain in a degraded state and will impact the cluster's ability to upgrade.",
