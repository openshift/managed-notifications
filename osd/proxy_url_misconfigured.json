  "description": "Your cluster requires you to take action because your cluster-wide proxy configuration re-encrypts egress traffic, and you have not excluded required URLs from re-encryption.  Your cluster's monitoring stack cannot function correctly until you exclude the required URLs from re-encryption. Without action, your cluster's SLA may be impacted, along with your ability to upgrade.
